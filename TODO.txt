So in terms of things left, its:
- User authentication
- Taking inputted values from the search page and displaying house results in the results page. Clicking on one of the results takes you to the booking page (where you can book) with all that house's info
- Storing inputted values from the Host a Home page into the database
- Some pages have a BOOKED HOMES button on the topbar. When you click on this a dropdown menu of all the homes the user booked needs to appear. Clicking on one of the options takes you to the booked house page that displays that house's info
- Some pages have a LISTED HOMES button on the topbar. When you click on this a dropdown menu of all the homes the user listed needs to appear. Clicking on one of the options takes you to the listed homes page that displays that house's info

Page transitions and displaying the info is more my end, getting all the info is more php so we can collaborate. Let me know if u need anything as well.
